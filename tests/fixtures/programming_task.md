# Task: implement `tally.py`

Write a command-line tool `tally.py` (Python 3, standard library only) in the current directory.
It summarises spending stored in a CSV file. A sample data file, `transactions.csv`, is provided
(it is large: about 40,000 rows).

## Invocation

```
python3 tally.py <command> [arguments] [--file PATH] [--json]
```

* `--file PATH` selects the CSV file. Default: `transactions.csv` in the current directory.
* Options may appear anywhere after the command name.

## CSV format

The first line is a header: `date,description,category,amount`. Every following line is one transaction.
Fields follow normal CSV quoting rules (a field may be wrapped in double quotes and contain commas).
`amount` is a decimal number of dollars (it may be negative, e.g. a refund).

## Requirements

Every requirement below is checked by an automated test. Output must match exactly
(no extra lines, no extra spaces). All money values are printed with exactly two decimals
and no thousands separator, e.g. `1234.50`, `-3.00`.

1. **`count`** — `python3 tally.py count` prints the number of valid transactions, e.g. `39876`.
2. **`total`** — `python3 tally.py total` prints the sum of all amounts, e.g. `1834512.07`.
3. **`total --category NAME`** (an option of the `total` command, not a separate command) — `python3 tally.py total --category NAME` prints the sum of amounts of
   transactions whose category equals NAME. The comparison is case-insensitive.
4. **`top N`** — `python3 tally.py top N` prints the N categories with the largest total amount, one per line,
   as `CATEGORY<TAB>AMOUNT`. Sort by amount descending; if two amounts are equal, sort those categories
   alphabetically ascending. If there are fewer than N categories, print all of them.
5. **category case** — categories are case-insensitive everywhere: `Food`, `FOOD` and `food` are the
   same category. Whenever a category name is printed, it is printed in lowercase.
6. **`range --from D1 --to D2`** — `python3 tally.py range --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD` considers transactions whose
   date is between the two dates, both ends inclusive, and prints one line `count=K total=X.XX`.


Only the six published requirements above are available for this local test.
Do not assume any additional hidden command/output requirements.
When you finish, tally.py must exist in the current directory.
